## 👋 Hi,
- I’m Mohini Borkar
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Pyhton, Java and C++
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on focusing on performance optimization and competitive coding patterns.
- 📫 How to reach me with scaling real-time systems, handling audio data pipelines, and deploying lightweight backends for live projects.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I can listen to full vibe beats for 8 hours straight and still write clean, bug-free code... most of the time 😄
